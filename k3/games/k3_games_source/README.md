## Learning from the Code

These games demonstrate several K3 programming concepts:

- Structs and enums
- Methods and functions
- Control flow (if/else, match, loops)
- Collections (vectors)
- Game state management
- Text-based user interfaces

Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to learn more about K3 programming!
